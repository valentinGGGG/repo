Assembled background story : A bear with boundless self-love and self-assurance takes a deep breath. The fresh air is filled with the aroma of flowers and plants, making it feel incredibly comfortable. The sunlight filters through the dense foliage and falls on its body, warm and soft. The bear walks slowly along the forest path, occasionally stopping to smell the blooming wild flowers. The wind brushes past its face, bringing a cool breeze and seemingly whispering the secrets of nature.
He walks to an open meadow surrounded by towering trees, with a clear stream in the center. The bear walks over and gently taps the water with his paw, sending ripples spreading out. His satisfied smile is reflected in the water. Far from the hustle and bustle of human society, in this quiet forest, the bear feels a sense of freedom and happiness like never before.
In a trance, the flames burned the entire field, consuming everything it was proud of. The river turned blood red, the trees burned away all tranquility, the wind whipped up the tongues of fire, the surface of the water steamed, as if in silent mourning. The bear's eyes shed tears until There was nothing left to shed but blood. In the pupils, which reflected the light of the fire, anger filled. It was humans. It was humans. It was humans. It was humans. It was humans. It was humans. It was humans. It was humans. It was humans. It was humans. It was humans. It was humans. It was humans. It was humans. It was humans. It was humans. It was humans. It was humans. It was humans. It was humans. It was humans. It was humans. It was humans. It was humans. It was humans. It was humans. It was humans. It was humans. It was humans. It was humans. It was humans. It was humans. It was humans. It was humans. It was humans. It was humans. It was humans. It was humans. It was humans. It was humans. It was humans. It was humans. It was humans. It was humans. It was humans. It was humans. It was humans. 
In the forest, the flames rage and consume everything. The trees struggle in the flames, their leaves torn off and scattered in the air as ashes. The once gentle and self-loving bear is now forced to stand in the middle of this ruin. The peace in its eyes has long been replaced by anger and hatred. The wind whips past its face, no longer a soft whisper, but a hiss full of resentment. It looks at the scene before it, its body trembling, as if its heart is being squeezed by an invisible hand.
In a trance, the earth began to shake, and a green mist rose from the soil, surrounding the bear cub. Its fur twisted in the mist, and strange blood vessels bulged under its skin, as if the vengeful spirits of the forest had been injected into its body. It let out a hoarse growl in pain, and its body began to deform in silent agony. Hair fell off, skin tore, and blood dripped onto the ground, turning into wriggling tentacles that pierced the ground and burrowed into the earth.
The tentacled monster gradually revealed its form. The once cute and innocent appearance was long gone, replaced by a hideous and distorted monster image. Its eyes flashed with a dark green light, revealing unfathomable hatred. It let out a low growl, and its tentacles waved in the air like evil spirits, raising up countless ashes. The soul of the forest has merged with it. It is no longer what it was, but the embodiment of vengeance, the transformation of the earth's anger.
In the light of fire and blood, it steps towards the city. Traffic lights flash, neon lights distort, and the light from street lamps intertwines with its greenish-black eyes, creating a strange scene. Where the tentacles pass, buildings collapse and blood splatters, as if the music of death is playing through the city. On the broken streets, bodies lay in a heap, and the blood flowed along the pavement, converging into a small river, drawing hideous patterns on the ground. The tentacles of the bear extended and waved continuously, smashing everything to pieces. The blood stained its body red, thick and hot.
However, the human army soon appeared, and the oncoming gunfire exploded in the air. The bear swung its tentacles, knocking the incoming bullets and bombs away, and the streets were completely reduced to ruins by its rampage. However, the next moment, a harsh sound of breaking air passed through, and it felt a tingling pain. Those special bullets shot into its body, tearing through its flesh. The bear roared, its body began to regenerate, and the wounds healed quickly, but when it looked down, it couldn't regenerate at the legs, as if being stopped by an unknown force.
Its body stiffened, and its tentacles lost their vitality in the air, hanging limply to the ground. Blood flowed from the severed legs, covering the ground. It tried to stand up again, but found that its body was no longer under its control. Its strength was dissipating, its tentacles retracting one by one, and its skin gradually becoming dull. A trace of fear welled up in its green eyes, and it realized that it was no longer able to struggle. It was trapped in place, like a beast at the mercy of others.
The wind howled, raising the dust on the ground, and the air was filled with the smell of blood and death. The moonlight shone coldly on its body, highlighting its severed body. The bear's body could no longer regenerate, and it could only helplessly collapse to the ground, the world before its eyes gradually blurring. It knew that this was the end for it, and the end of the forest with it.
The rain fell heavily, washing the reddened earth. The bear's consciousness was in a fog, and its memories flashed before its eyes like broken images. It remembered the forest, the fragrant flowers and plants, and the clear stream... But now, all of this had become nothing. Tears once again slipped from its eyes and dripped onto the cold ground.
The following morning, the rain finally stopped. The bear's body was soaked in blood. It slowly looked up at the ruins ahead. That was its proud home, now destroyed and in pieces. It had thought it could protect everything, but in the end it had fallen victim to fate
The air after the rain was filled with a smell of decay and scorched flesh, spreading around the bear's broken body. Its consciousness struggled in the fog, as if hovering on the brink of death. But it did not die. In the darkness, it heard the sound of metal rubbing against metal, the sharp sound of steel being cut, and the noisy murmur of humans. Gradually, the sounds grew closer and closer, and a cold, mechanical hand dragged its body away from the pool of blood. It tried to open its eyes, but all it could see in its pupils was a blurry vision – machinery, metal, and flashing cold light.
The bear was taken to a secret factory, surrounded by the towering figures of humans, wearing masks and holding tools. Their eyes were cold and merciless. The harsh light of the incandescent lamp shone on the operating table, exposing the bear cub's body to the naked iron. The walls of the factory were cold, echoing with the roar of machinery, like an unending nightmare. The bear cub tried to struggle, but its legs had been cut off and its tentacles hung limply, so it could only let these humans fix it to the table.
The operation began, the sound of sawing filling the room. The bear's body was dissected, stripped, and reconstructed. The mechanical arms worked with precision, connecting its flesh and blood to steel. Cold steel plates replaced its skin, and the arms pierced its spine, nerves and cables intertwined. The bear wanted to scream in pain, but it couldn't make any sound. Blood mixed with lubricant and dripped onto the ground, gradually forming a glaring red and black.
A solitary light bulb hung from the factory ceiling, flickering a weak light that outlined the bear's body like the silhouette of a mechanical monster. Its legs were no longer furry flesh, but cold metal frames connected to two rocket jets. The jet is also covered with symbols and pipes, as if mocking its fate of losing its freedom. The once soft limbs are now equipped with robotic arms, with sharp blades at the fingertips, which tremble slightly as the workers debug them.
Finally, humans embedded a control chip in its forehead, a cold-light flashing chip connected to its brain. Countless lines extended from the chip, eroding its nerves and completely transforming it into a mechanical monster. The people in the factory stood around, coldly watching their masterpiece. The bear was transformed into a heavily armed war machine, with rocket jets on its legs ready to ignite at any time, sending it to the battlefield.
“Start it!” A voice commanded.
A harsh electrical sound rang out, and a hot flame shot out of the jet. The bear's body shot up, its mechanical arms swung, and its blades cut a cold path through the air. Flames shot out of its legs, carrying it quickly into the air, before it landed heavily, sending sparks flying. The control chip sent strong electrical signals through its brain, forcing it to act on human orders. It wanted to struggle, to resist, but its body was no longer under its control. It has lost its freedom and been completely transformed into a human weapon.
The once soft heart is now gradually numbing in the coldness of the machine. The bear's memories are erased layer by layer, and only fragments of them flash through its mind. It seems to see the forest, an open meadow, and the clear stream... However, those memories are soon erased by the current from the chip, leaving only emptiness and coldness. It is no longer the carefree bear, but a walking corpse transformed into a mechanical monster.
The rocket jet emitted a dull roar, driving it to experiment with its new abilities in the factory. With each jet, flames scorched the ground, leaving blackened marks. The factory workers stood in the distance, observing with indifference, as if they were watching the successful commissioning of a perfect weapon. Deep down, the bear felt a vague sense of sadness, but it could not express it, and it could only act on orders.
“Mechanical Bear, go!” The command came from the control center.
Flames spewed and dust filled the air. The bear's legs burst into flames, lifting it into the air and sending it hurtling into the night sky. The city gradually grew smaller and blurry beneath its feet. Its gaze was vacant, and the once warm light in its eyes had been replaced by a cold red glow. It was as if it were a soulless puppet, manipulated by humans to rush from one battlefield to the next.
Perhaps somewhere in its heart, there is still a trace of its memory of the forest. But now, it cannot turn back. It has become a mechanical monster, a weapon of war driven by others.
